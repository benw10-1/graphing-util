# Graphing Utility

## Description

This is a graphing utility built using Python, the PyGame library, and the Sympy library. The application uses Sympy to find the solution to the equation within our width and height bounds for the window. This particular app was challenging because you have to translate each point yielded from the equation to coordinates on the PyGame plane. Using this idea, I was able to draw lines, axis, and indicators that are to scale.
